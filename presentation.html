<b>Simplified and Generalized</b>
The idea for this tutorial came as Austin and I were looking at different solutions to ETL jobs/workflow engines that
to be utilized by our team.<br>
This is an example of a DAG, a directed a cyclic graph we have in production.<br>
The tools we will see give you the ability to construct these DAGs, monitor, recover from failure and manage dependency.<br>
This tutorial will give you initial hands on experience on using these tools<br>

We hope you had opportunity to download the repos and install the requirements. If not you will have
Have some additional time to do this.<br>
The tutorial is split into two sections. In each section we will present the engine we are working with.<br>
We will then have a series of lessons where in each lesson we will cover some theory and then you can practice<br>

            <h4>Airflow</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Originally by Airbnb</li>
                <li>"programmatically author, schedule and monitor workflows"</li>
                <li>Distributed</li>
                <li>Not for data streaming</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
It was developed originally by Maxime Beauchemin at Airbnb. History: started in 2014, brought to Airbnb github in 2015.<br>
Moved to Apache incubation (currently) in 2016.<br>
By Authoring DAGs using python you will get great flexibility. With that Airflow gives you many features such as rich UI and scheduling tools.<br>
As we will see was designed with multiple components that enable it to be very scalable and stable.<br>
This is not a data streaming solution (Spark streaming, storm), similar solutions are Pinball, Oozie, Azkaban, and Luigi.

            <h4>Airflow Components</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>UI</li>
                <li>MetaData Database(Postgres)</li>
                <li>Scheduler(Executor)</li>
                <li>Workers*</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
Airflow UI is a Flask application that is used to display, monitor and control our DAG execution.<br>
Metadata database is used to store information about the current state of DAGs and tasks to facilitate UI presentation and scheduler operation<br>
The scheduler is a python process that runs and is used to schedule DAG and tasks runs.<br>
Executors: Local & sequential - mostly dev. Celery, Mesos, Dask - for scaling out and having workers. We will use celery to demonstrate it.
The worker actually execute the python code that was defined.

Stats about the DAG run, Code, Graph.<br>
Show details about a DAG that ran, code<br>
Run a DAG and show logs etc.<br>

Show components of our Docker setup and how we will work (DAGs directory, /tmp/work directory).<br>
Expand on how each container is created.
Show the flower UI - but won't need it in this tutorial.

                <br><br>
                Verify all components of Airflow are working and run the run_me_first DAG.<br><br>
                Explore the UI and see information about the DAG run.<br><br>
                <b>Bonus</b>: Update DAG code so that there are errors during a task run. See details of failed DAG run.

            <h4>Airflow DAGs</h4>
            <pre><code data-trim data-noescape>
                default_args = {
                    'owner': 'pycon',
                    'start_date': datetime(2015, 6, 1),
                }
                dag = DAG('tutorial', default_args=default_args,
                          schedule_interval=None)
            </code></pre>
        <aside class="notes">
DAG - Directed Acyclic Graph. Each node on the Airflow DAG is a task with some logic to execute.<br>
The only job Airflow has is know when to execute DAGs identify dependencies and execute tasks accordingly<br>
These are called default_args b/c this is eventually passed to the tasks by the DAG. In order to avoid duplication<br>
we specify it in DAG level. You must pass <b>owner</b> and <b>start_date</b>.<br>
There are many more parameters you can pass: email, pool, priority, and_date. And some others we will see later.<br>
That's it now you have see how you can define a DAG!<br>
schedule_interval - Airflow ties the dag to scheduled run, if you don't set it to None the default is once a day!<br>
During the tutorial I recommend to set it to None and trigger it manually.

                t2.set_upstream(t1)
            </code></pre>
        <aside class="notes">
We have a DAG defined but it doesn't do much, right?<br>
This is where operators come in. Here we instantiate a two bash operators and pass a bash command to execute.<br>
Once an operator was instantiated it is now a task on the DAG. <br>
We also define a dependency between our tasks by setting the first to be upstream from the second<br>

This is where I find a lot of the power of defining your workflow using Python is. You are not limited to a static config file<br>
The tasks can be very dynamic as you can see here in a loop.<br>
Notice you need to give a unique name to each task. But you can also pass task specific information in <b>op_kwargs</b><br>
it is important you do not reuse the op_kwargs between tasks to avoid aliasing (if the information changes).<br>
You must set <b>provide_context=True</b> in order for op_kwargs to be passed.
A pool will limit how many tasks can run in parallel. You can add a pool using the web UI but also using the CLI(demo)

                This is the most basic way to build your custom operator. You will have a similar init and the magic<br>
                happens in the `execute`
                apply_defaults -     Function decorator that Looks for an argument named "default_args", and
                fills the unspecified arguments from it.<br>
                You don't need to worry much about it just know this is what makes your class into a real operator you
                can run inside of a DAG. Just inheriting from BaseOperator is not enough.

You need to do some setup by creating a mock DAG and a task.<br>
But it does open the option that when your logic or your use case becomes complex where you need to create your own DAGs<br>
You have the ability to create good unit tests around them.

<aside class="notes">
Scheduler, Web, Worker all need the same DAG directory. Deployment should be fast. We haven't seen issues but might be <br>
good idea to pause the scheduler.<br>
It is a good practice to have it in version control and deploy once tests passed.<br>

                <li>Separate logic from DAGs</li>
            </ul>
<aside class="notes">
Separate to subdirectory based on different parts of responsibility or systems.<br>
For easier maintenance logic should leave either in separate directory or even different package.<br>
You can put you custom operators in the same path as the DAGs or in plugins directory but then restart of the scheduler is needed.
